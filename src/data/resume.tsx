    "Computer Engineering @ RHIT ('26).\n Minor in Computer Science & Economics.\nOS & Computer Architecture • Embedded/Robotics • Web.",
  summary:
    "I’m a computer engineering student focused on low-level OS (RISC-V microkernels), computer architecture research, and hands-on firmware/embedded/robotics—working at the intersection of the humanities and technology. I’m here for the hard problems and the quiet joy when a project finally comes alive. Recent work includes a teaching-focused microkernel (MorpheOS), PIM/DPU simulation studies, open-source educational robotics, and campus apps like ParkSmart.

        "Built an embedded system on a TI MSP432 to automate plant care. Integrated soil moisture, light, and temperature sensors; controlled pump, grow light, and fan via configurable profiles. Wrote drivers for NeoPixel LEDs and sensor interfacing, using interrupts and ADC sampling. Implemented real-time scheduling with the microcontroller RTC. Led a 2-person team, collaborating on mechanical and hardware integration. Practiced low-power firmware design, SPI/UART/I²C protocols, and oscilloscope-based debugging.",
